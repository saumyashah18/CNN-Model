Convolutional Neural Network
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models commonly used for analyzing visual data. CNNs consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers apply filters to the input data to extract features, while pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions, making the network computationally efficient and robust to variations in the input. Fully connected layers integrate the extracted features to make predictions. CNNs have achieved significant success in various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
